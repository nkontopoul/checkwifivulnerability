The provided Python program performs the following tasks:

    Retrieve OS Information Using PowerShell:
        The function get_os_info() runs an inline PowerShell command to retrieve detailed information about the operating system. It captures properties such as CsName, WindowsVersion, WindowsBuildLabEx, WindowsEditionId, and WindowsInstallationType using the Get-ComputerInfo cmdlet. The output is parsed and stored in a dictionary.

    Check if the OS is Windows 11:
        The function is_windows_11() checks the retrieved OS information to determine if the operating system is Windows 11. It looks for specific identifiers in WindowsEditionId and ensures the WindowsBuildLabEx build number is 22000 or higher. This helps to correctly identify Windows 11, including Enterprise LTSC editions.

    Check if a Specific KB Update is Installed:
        The function check_kb_installed() uses the wmic command to list all installed updates and checks if the specified KB number (e.g., "KB5039212") is present in the list. It returns True if the update is found and False otherwise.

    Main Execution:
        The main part of the script first retrieves and prints the OS information.
        It then checks if the OS is Windows 11 using the is_windows_11() function.
        If the OS is Windows 11, it proceeds to check if the specified KB update is installed using check_kb_installed().
        If the update is found, it prints a message indicating that the system is protected against CVE-2024-30078.
        If the update is not found, it prints a message indicating that the system is not protected.
        If the OS is not Windows 11, it prints a message stating that the script only runs on Windows 11.# Windows 11 KB Update Checker

This Python program performs the following tasks:

### Retrieve OS Information Using PowerShell:
The function `get_os_info()` runs an inline PowerShell command to retrieve detailed information about the operating system. It captures properties such as `CsName`, `WindowsVersion`, `WindowsBuildLabEx`, `WindowsEditionId`, and `WindowsInstallationType` using the `Get-ComputerInfo` cmdlet. The output is parsed and stored in a dictionary.

### Check if the OS is Windows 11:
The function `is_windows_11()` checks the retrieved OS information to determine if the operating system is Windows 11. It looks for specific identifiers in `WindowsEditionId` and ensures the `WindowsBuildLabEx` build number is 22000 or higher. This helps to correctly identify Windows 11, including Enterprise LTSC editions.

### Check if a Specific KB Update is Installed:
The function `check_kb_installed()` uses the `wmic` command to list all installed updates and checks if the specified KB number (e.g., "KB5039212") is present in the list. It returns `True` if the update is found and `False` otherwise.

### Main Execution:
1. The main part of the script first retrieves and prints the OS information.
2. It then checks if the OS is Windows 11 using the `is_windows_11()` function.
3. If the OS is Windows 11, it proceeds to check if the specified KB update is installed using `check_kb_installed()`.
4. If the update is found, it prints a message indicating that the system is protected against CVE-2024-30078.
5. If the update is not found, it prints a message indicating that the system is not protected.
6. If the OS is not Windows 11, it prints a message stating that the script only runs on Windows 11.

## Usage

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `check_kb.py`.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the script using:
 
   python cve.py
